\maketitle

This document contains an overview of all the work done for the dissertation and where to find the relevant changes.

\section{Dataformats}
\subsection{HDF5 and JSON}
Support for both of these formats has been added. The changes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The libraries have been added in main/resources/lib
\item Both are linked in CMakeCPP.cmake
\item HDF5 is also linked separately in main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GeoGrid}
GeoGrids can be written to and read from files. Supported formats are JSON, HDF5 and Protobuf. Documentation is provided using Doxygen, and through the user manual.
The involved files are:

\begin{itemize}
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridWriter.h
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridFileWriter.h
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridStreamWriter.h
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridWriterFactory [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridHDF5Writer [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridJSONWriter [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/GeoGridProtoWriter [.h / .cpp]
\end{itemize}

The files concerning the readers are named analogously (where 'Writer' is replaced with 'Reader').
The files involved with testing this functionality are:

\begin{itemize}
\item test/cpp/gtester/geopop/io (Appropriately named tests can be found here)
\item test/cpp/gtester/geopop/io/GeoGridCompare [.h / .cpp]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Household}
Households can be read from JSON and CSV files. Documentation is provided using Doxygen.
Changed files are:

\begin{itemize}
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/HouseholdJSONReader [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/ReaderFactory [.h / .cpp]
\item test/cpp/gtester/geopop/io/HouseHoldJSONReaderTest.cpp
\end{itemize}


\section{Daycare and preschool}
Two new ContactTypes have been added. Documentation is available in the user manual. The involved files  are:

\begin{itemize}
\item main/cpp/geopop/generators/DaycareGenerator.cpp
\item main/cpp/geopop/populators/PreschoolPopulator.cpp
\item main/cpp/GeoGridConfig [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/proto/geogrid.proto
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/proto\_pb/geogrid\_pb [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/contact/AgeContactProfile.cpp
\item main/cpp/contact/ContactType [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/contact/Infector.cpp
\item main/cpp/pop/DefaultPopBuilder.cpp
\item main/cpp/pop/GeoPopBuilder.cpp
\item main/cpp/pop/Person [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/pop/Population [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/pop/SurveySeeder.cpp
\item test/cpp/gtester (in the \emph{generators} and \emph{populators} subdirectories, tests can be found
\end{itemize}

\section{Visualiser}
A separate executable has been built in Qt to allow the visualisation of epidemiological data. The user manual contains a section on this functionality. \\
The files related to the visualiser program can be found in the directory \emph{main/cpp/visualiser}. \\
Epioutput files can be generated by stride to serve as input for the visualiser. This is also documented in the manual. The files involved in the generation are:

\begin{itemize}
\item main/cpp/execs/ControlHelper.cpp
\item main/cpp/viewers/EpiOutputFileViewer [.h / .cpp]
\item main/cpp/viewers/EpiOutputFile [.h / .cpp]
\end{itemize}

\section{Workplace size distribution}
The simulation has been modified to account for different sizes of workplaces. This is described in the manual. Files involved are:

\begin{itemize}
\item main/cpp/geopop/generators/WorkplaceGenerator.cpp (and analogous populator)
\item main/cpp/geopop/io/WorkplaceReader.h
\item test/cpp/gtester (contains appropriate tests)
\end{itemize}

\section{Demographic profiles}
The simulation will be modified to account for different demographic profiles. This will be explained in the manual.
