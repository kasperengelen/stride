\paragraph{} The Stride software includes a visualisation tool with which the disease spreading can be shown on a geographical map. When the visualiser is opened, the user is presented with a geographical map, a sidebar to the left and a toolbar on top. An overview can be seen in figure \ref{fig:screenshot_overview}

The toolbar contains various controls:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open file: Opens a open file dialog.
\item Save file: Opens a save to image file dialog.
\item Select Radius: Opens the radius selection dialog.
\item Select Rectangle: Opens the rectangle selection dialog.
\item Play-button: Enables/disables the automatic playback of the simulation results.
\item Timestep-slider: Allows the user to select a certain timestep of the simulation.
\item Health status dropdown: Allows the user to select a health status that is to be displayed.
\end{itemize}
