\section{Epioutput}
\label{section:epioutput}
The visualiser is capable of loading files with epidemiological data, generated using stride. These files are referred to as 'epioutput' files, and can be used in three formats. They are generated by stride if provided with an appropriate configuration file. In order to generate an epioutput file, there are three parameters that can be set in the configuration file:

\begin{compactdesc}
\item [output\_epi] \ \\
    This parameter takes a boolean value indicating whether or not epioutput should be generated. Defaults to \emph{false}.
\item [output\_epi\_format] \ \\
    This parameter indicates the desired format for the epioutput. Currently supports '\emph{json}' and '\emph{hdf5}'.
\item [output\_epi\_interval] \ \\
    This parameter can be used to set an interval between recorded timesteps, e.g. and interval of 10 will capture the data once every 10 timesteps in the stride simulation. Defaults to 1.
\end{compactdesc}

The exact layout of the data depends on the format used, though all formats are similar. Generally, the file will contain a collection of timesteps. Each timestep will contain data about every location, more specifically, the health statuses of every \emph{ContactPoolType} in that location as well as its geographical data. This way, the visualiser can extract and display this data.
